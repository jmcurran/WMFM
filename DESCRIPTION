Description: This package allows users to construct and fit (generalised) linear 
models and get the fitted model. We have observed that for many learners of 
statistics, there is a disconnect between the regression table and the fitted 
model used to compute the fitted values. This is further compounded by the 
presence of factors in the model formula. This application allows the user to 
construct an (additive) (generalised) linear model using dropdown boxes and 
drag and drop. The model fit can then be obtained. The regression table, along
with a detailed prompt, is sent to a Large Language Model (LLM), which provides
the fitted equation(s), and a description of the fitted model. The app also
provides a nice plot of the fitted model in situations where there is only one 
continuous covariate.
