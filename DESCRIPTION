Title: Explore Fitted Linear and Generalised Linear Models with Shiny
Version: 0.0.4.0000
Authors@R: 
    person(
        given = "James",

Description: Provides a Shiny application that helps learners connect regression 
    tables to fitted (generalised) linear models. Users construct additive models 
    via drag-and-drop controls, obtain fitted equations and plain-language 
    explanations generated by a large language model, and view plots of the fitted 
    model in settings with a single continuous covariate.
