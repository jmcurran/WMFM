\title{Build a prompt asking for fitted-model equations}
\usage{
lmToPrompt(model)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object, typically of class \code{"lm"} or
\code{"glm"}.}
}
\value{
A character scalar containing the prompt text to send to the
language model.
}
\description{
Given a fitted linear or generalised linear model, construct a detailed
prompt that asks a language model to write down the fitted-model
equations. The prompt includes a description of the model, the response
and predictors, and the coefficient table.
}
\details{
The rules in the prompt are tailored for teaching: for additive models
with factors, equations are requested separately for each factor level,
and for interaction models, the arithmetic behind changes in intercept
and slope is emphasised.
