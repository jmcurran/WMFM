\title{Extract a noun phrase for the response variable from dataset documentation}
\usage{
extractResponseNounPhraseFromDoc(dsDoc, responseVar)
}
\arguments{
\item{dsDoc}{Character scalar. Plain-text dataset documentation.}

\item{responseVar}{Character scalar. Name of the response variable.}
}
\value{
Character scalar noun phrase, or \code{NULL} if not found.
}
\description{
Attempts to infer a short human-friendly description of the response variable
(e.g. "exam score", "weekly income", "probability of success") from a plain-text
dataset help/documentation string.
}
\details{
The extraction is heuristic: it looks for common patterns such as:
\itemize{
\item A line like \code{"responseVar: ..."} or \code{"responseVar - ..."}
\item A variables table/bullets where the response variable is described
}
If nothing reliable is found, it returns \code{NULL}.
