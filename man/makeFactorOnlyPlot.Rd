\title{Plot response by factor predictors for factor-only models}
\usage{
makeFactorOnlyPlot(
  model,
  data,
  ciType = c("standard", "sandwich"),
  hcType = c("HC0", "HC3")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object (e.g. \code{lm}, \code{glm}).}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables used to fit the model.}

\item{ciType}{Confidence-interval type. One of \code{"standard"} (model-based)
or \code{"sandwich"} (robust).}

\item{hcType}{Heteroskedasticity-consistent estimator type for robust CIs.
One of \code{"HC0"} or \code{"HC3"}. Only used when \code{ciType="sandwich"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Produces a grouped plot for models with only factor predictors.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Uses boxplots when all groups have at least 10 observations
\item Uses jittered point plots when any group has fewer than 10 observations
\item Adds fitted means and 95\% confidence intervals alongside each group
\item Supports standard (model-based) and robust (sandwich) confidence intervals
\item Applies a log(1 + y) scale when the model is Poisson
}

For multiple factor predictors, groups are defined by their interaction.

Robust confidence intervals are computed on the linear predictor scale using
X V X^T, where V is either vcov(model) or sandwich::vcovHC(model, type = ...).
For GLMs, intervals are then transformed back to the response scale using the
inverse link function.
