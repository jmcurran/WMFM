\title{Detect factor-only predictor models}
\usage{
isFactorOnlyPredictorModel(m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A fitted model object, typically an \code{lm} or \code{glm}.}
}
\value{
A logical scalar. \code{TRUE} if all predictors in
\code{model.frame(m)} are factors; otherwise \code{FALSE}.
}
\description{
Determines whether a fitted model has \emph{only factor predictors} in its
model frame (i.e., every predictor column is a factor). This is used to
switch the "Fitted equations" view into an ANOVA-style "Fitted means" view.
}
\details{
The response is not checked for being a factor; in typical "fitted means"
usage the response is numeric and predictors are factors. Intercept-only
models (no predictors) return \code{FALSE}.
}
\examples{
df = data.frame(y = rnorm(12), A = factor(rep(letters[1:3], each = 4)))
mod = lm(y ~ A, data = df)
isFactorOnlyPredictorModel(mod)
