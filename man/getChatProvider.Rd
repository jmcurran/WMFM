\title{Create a safe chat provider for WMFM}
\usage{
getChatProvider()
}
\value{
A chat provider object created by \code{ellmer::chat_ollama()}, or a dummy
provider object that throws a user-friendly error on use.
}
\description{
Returns an Ollama-based chat provider (from the \pkg{ellmer} package)
using the base URL configured via the \code{wmfm.ollama_base_url} option.
If the provider cannot be constructed (e.g., the Ollama server is
unreachable or misconfigured), the function returns a dummy chat provider
that consistently throws a clear, user-friendly error message whenever its
\code{chat()} method is called. This prevents the Shiny app from crashing
and allows it to fail gracefully when the language model is unavailable.
}
\details{
The default URL is:
\preformatted{
http://corrin.stat.auckland.ac.nz:11434
}

The dummy provider returned on failure has class
\code{"wmfm_dummy_chat_provider"} and contains a single method,
\code{chat()}, which always raises an informative error. This ensures that
downstream code that attempts to call the LLM receives a clear diagnostic
message instead of an unexpected exception.
