\title{Construct a fitted-mean equation from model coefficients}
\usage{
makeMeanEquation(m, oneRowDf, label)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A fitted model object, typically an \code{lm} or \code{glm}.}

\item{oneRowDf}{A one-row data frame containing predictor values for which
to construct the equation. Column names must match the model terms.}

\item{label}{A character label to place on the left-hand side of the equation.}
}
\value{
A length-1 character string containing the equation (may include
newline characters for multi-step GLM working).
}
\description{
Builds an explicit equation for a single fitted mean using the model's
coefficient vector and the corresponding design row from
\code{model.matrix()}. This is designed to show how each fitted mean is
constructed from the regression table coefficients.
}
\details{
For GLMs, the regression coefficients combine to form the linear predictor
(often written \eqn{\eta}). This function shows that linear predictor and
then shows the back-transformation to the mean on the response scale.

\examples{
df = data.frame(y = rnorm(8), A = factor(rep(c("a","b"), each = 4)))
mod = lm(y ~ A, data = df)
oneRow = data.frame(A = factor("b", levels = levels(df$A)))
makeMeanEquation(mod, oneRow, "Mean(A=b)")
