\title{Choose fitted-means table layout for 1–3 factor predictors}
\usage{
chooseFactorLayout(mf, predictors)
}
\arguments{
\item{mf}{A model frame (as returned by \code{model.frame(m)}).}

\item{predictors}{Character vector of predictor names (columns in \code{mf}).}
}
\value{
A list describing the layout:
\describe{
\item{type}{One of \code{"oneWay"}, \code{"twoWay"}, \code{"threeWay"}, or \code{"other"}.}
\item{rowVar}{Row factor name (for \code{"oneWay"} and \code{"twoWay"} and \code{"threeWay"}).}
\item{colVar}{Column factor name (for \code{"twoWay"} and \code{"threeWay"}).}
\item{splitVar}{Split factor name (for \code{"threeWay"} only).}
}
}
\description{
Implements the layout rules for displaying fitted means when all predictors
are factors:
\itemize{
\item 1 factor: one-way table (single column of fitted means).
\item 2 factors: two-way table with the factor having the most levels on rows.
\item 3 factors: a set of two-way tables split by the factor with the fewest
levels. Within each two-way table, the factor with the most levels is on rows
and the remaining factor is on columns.

\examples{
df = data.frame(
  y = rnorm(24),
  A = factor(rep(c("a1","a2"), each = 12)),
  B = factor(rep(paste0("b", 1:4), times = 6)),
  C = factor(rep(paste0("c", 1:6), times = 4))
)
mod = lm(y ~ A * B * C, data = df)
mf = model.frame(mod)
